- Add indexes to  database to improve performance
- Order and customer references are more human readable than before
- Refactor intl process. A domain is created for each templates and modules :
    - core => for thelia core translations
    - bo.template_name (eg : bo.default) => for each backoffice template
    - fo.template_name (eg : fo.default) => for each frontoffice template
    - pdf.template_name (eg : pdf.default) => for each pdf template
    - email.template_name (eg : email.default) => for each email template
    - modules :
        - module_code (eg : paypal) => fore module core translations
        - module_code.ai (eg : paypal.ai) => used in AdminIncludes templates
        - bo.module_code.template_name (eg : bo.paypal.default) => used in back office template
        - fo.module_code.template_name (eg : fo.paypal.default) => used in front office template
- new parameter for smarty ```intl``` function. The parameter ```d``` allow you to specify the translation domain (as explain before). This parameter is optional
- the ```d``` can be omitted if you use ```{default_translation_domain domain='bo.default'}``` in your layout. If you use this smarty function, the ```d``` parameter is automatically set with the domain specify in ```default_translation_domain``` function
- We changed Thelia's license. Thelia is published  under the LGPL 3.0+ License

	- esi tag integrated, use {render_esi path="http://your-taget.tld/resource"}
	- if no reverse proxy detected, html is render instead of esi tag
	- if you can't install a reverse proxy like varnish, use the HttpCache (just uncomment line 14 in web/index.php file)
